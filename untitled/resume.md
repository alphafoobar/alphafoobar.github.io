I'm excited about the increasing rate of innovation in the software industry. Especially in regards to 
automation, virtualisation and process optimisation. My goal is to meet business objective and produce 
quality code that is secure, maintainable and robust. 

In order maintain high availability, low risk, low complexity rapid change; my philosophy is lightweight, 
incremental, decoupled releases of sensibly tested, stateless, single responsibility components.

# How do I multi-task to reduce the context shifting overhead
My goal is to enable multiple tasks to be completed in parallel with minimal context shifting. I prefer
to work on a single task until it is `development complete`, or even [done](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-done/).

But there tend to be several different activities that come up in a day:
- Starting a new development task! (src-1)
- Incorporating feedback on a pull request to gain peer review approval! (src-2)
- Peer reviewing a colleagues pull request (src-pr-1)
- Fixing a bug that was found in manual testing (src-uat)
- Investigating a production support enquiry (src-prod)

Structuring my directories in this way enables Git to do most of the work.

- [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) for distributed source control
- `workspace` per task, for example separate workspaces for
  - src-1, src-2, src-qa, src-uat, src-prod, src-misc
  - allowing segregation of tasks
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with a project per `workspace`
  - all projects required in 
- vagrant mint linux running with local directory sharing
